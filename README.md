# MTGSpoiler

This is a little project that I put together to send me alerts when a new MTG card is spoiled before the set comes out. It is really pretty simple, but I wanted to be able to run something every few minutes that will check for new cards. I just got tired of checking all the time and finding that there was nothing new. This was created so that I won't have to waste time checking when nothing new has come out. Hopefully it allows me to be more efficient with my time when I know that new cards are coming out.

Unfortunately, cards are only spoiled every couple of months. As a result, I am pausing any work on this project until the next set starts to be revealed.
